# Price-Calculator
Internal Price Calculator.

Please note that calculator has been designed for an Australian buiness in mind and as such add's a 10% GST amount to the final price that it output's.

If you are using this calculator outside of Australia you may need to make adjustments to the calculation.

The basic formula is as follows:

Assumption: Labour cost is $120/h broken down into 15 minute blocks ie: (15m = $30, 30m = $60)

Part Cost (ex GST) x MARKUP + LABOURAMOUNT x 1.1 (GST) = Output cost
